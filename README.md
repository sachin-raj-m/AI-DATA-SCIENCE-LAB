**Syllabus**

*Mandatory
1. Implement a program to perform operations like mean, median, mode, standard deviation,
percentile and various data distributions.
2. Review of python programming, Matrix operations, Programs using matplotlib / plotly /
bokeh / seaborn for data visualisation and programs to handle data using pandas*
3. Try to open a csv file and sort the content with respect to one column using python.
4. Implement a program to perform linear regression for a dataset that prevails in csv format*
5. Implement a program to perform logistic regression to classify a dataset. Print feature
importance after building model*
6. Implement k-Nearest Neighbour algorithm to classify any dataset. Print both correct and
wrong predictions. ML library classes can be used for this problem. Assume K=3.*
7. Write a program to construct a Support Vector Machine considering medical data. Use this
model to demonstrate the diagnosis of heart patients using the standard Heart Disease Data
Set*
8. Assuming a set of documents that need to be classified, use the na√Øve Bayesian Classifier
model to perform this task. Calculate the accuracy, precision, and recall for your data set*
9. Assuming a set of data that need to be classified, use a decision tree model to perform this
task. Preferably use any dataset like medical or others to evaluate the accuracy.*
10. Implement a program to perform Hill climbing algorithm.*
11. Implement convolutional neural network to classify images from any standard dataset in
the public domain using Keras framework. Reading and writing different types of dataset.
12. Write a program to find Correlation and Covariance between different features of a dataset
in csv format.*
13. Write a program to implement feature reduction using PCA. Calculate the
covariance between features to find the optimal number of PCA components.*


**Practice Questions**

1. Write a Python script to generate a list of random numbers and find their mean and
standard deviation.
2. Consider the river temperature data available at
https://catalogue.ceh.ac.uk/documents/b8a985f5-30b5-4234-9a62-03de60bf31f7. Create a
Python script to select only the data from "Swale at Catterick Bridge" location, and find the
mean temperature and median dissolved oxygen. Also plot a histogram showing the
distribution of temperature over the time period of study.
3. Consider the river temperature data available at
https://catalogue.ceh.ac.uk/documents/b8a985f5-30b5-4234-9a62-03de60bf31f7. Create a
Python script to perform linear regression to establish how temperature affects dissolved
oxygen levels. Test the model on the whole dataset and find the RMSE.
4. Perform logistic regression to classify Cleveland heart disease dataset. Print the feature
importance and accuracy. Drop least important attributes one by one and assess how the
accuracy and feature importance changes.
5. Find the correlation and covariance between different attributes of Cleveland heart disease
dataset. Which are the top 5 attributes closely related to the predicted attribute?
6. Perform Naive Bayes classification on the "glass" dataset from Kaggle. Interpret the
performance of the classifier, and evaluate why the accuracy value is what you obtained.
7. Use the "Car Evaluation Dataset" from UCI Machine Learning repository to generate a
decision tree and measure the performance.
8. Implement KNN algorithm to classify iris dataset. Print all necessary performance
measures.
9. Implement appropriate CNNs to classify (i) MNIST dataset, and (ii) Fashion MNIST
dataset. Redesign the CNN with different hyperparameters and evaluate the performance.
10. Implement dimensionality reduction on Car Evaluation dataset from UCI Machine
Learning repository using PCA. Try setting number of PCA components from 2 to 5,
and identify the composition that gives the best performance among all of them. Find
covariance among all features in the original dataset and try to justify the
performance.
